<h1>How to connect to our server from a Windows computer</h1>
<ol>
<li>Download WinSCP from <a href='http://winscp.net/download/winscp433setup.exe'>http://winscp.net/download/winscp433setup.exe</a></li>
<li>Install WinSCP. If you have the option, choose 'explorer view' rather than 'commander view'.</li>
<li>Make a new SFTP connection (not FTP - it won't work!). The 'host name' is 128.135.91.101</li>
<li>Use the same name and password as you do in the classroom.</li>
<li>Navigate in WinSCP to your Sites folder.</li>
<li>You can right-click on your files to edit them right in WinSCP, or you can drag-and-drop new files into the window.</li>
</ol>
<p>If any of these instructions are confusing or don't work, ask Mr. H about them tomorrow.</p>
