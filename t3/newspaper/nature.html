<p>Nature Explorers</p>
<p>By Anna S.</p>


<p>If students are interested in nature and like to explore, then they should sign up for
Nature Explorers.</p>
<p>When a student walks into room 226, he or she will hear sounds of crickets, see
lots of animals, and think what an interesting classroom. Everyone will want
to "explore."</p>

<p>Gwennan Ickes is the teacher of Nature Explorers. She learned a lot about nature by
spending time in the wilderness and reading many books.</p>

<p>Ickes also learned a lot about nature growing up in the country. "I spent a lot of time outside exploring," Ickes said. "I learned some at school at
various places, and I spent a lot of summers at summer camp.</p>

<p>Ickes teaches the students the many different ways in which nature works.
They begin by talking about energy and discuss how energy moves in nature by
looking at food chains, food webs and food pyramids.</p>

<p>Ickes is interested in teaching how different kinds of organisms are connected.
Students discuss classification and how animals are grouped together based on
characteristics they have in common.</p>

<p>Ickes explained how she teaches her students adaptation, which is how animals
develop certain body parts or certain ways of behaving to survive in their particular
habitat.</p>

<p>Ickes has a number of favorite projects.
"I like the project where we make up our own animal with special adaptations, and
then we make them out of different objects and write about them."</p>

<p>One of the students, Jonah Schloerb, said he particularly enjoyed the smelling game.
The smelling game is a guessing game in which students try to identify the smell of
different kinds of food hidden under.</p>

<p>But Ickes has another motive besides playing fun games. She thinks it is important
to teach children about nature, so they won't let anything bad happen to it.
If students like exploring, playing fun games, or learning about nature, then they will
enjoy the Nature Explorers class.</p>
