<p>Katy Sinclair, Mark Piane, and Illia Mazurek are the teachers of Summer Lab On Stage, or SLOS.</p>
<p>SLOS is a class where kids can be creative, and just be themselves, for example, they can be as weird as they want, and nobody will judge them.</p>
<p>"SLOS is about getting creative and musical campers into a theatre experience," Said Sinclair.</p>
<p>Sinclair has been teaching in general for 25 years. Piane has been teaching for 15 years, and Mazurek has been teaching for a total of 20 years.</p>
<p>"I was in high school, I started working with Mr. Biser in theatre. He asked Katy and I to do SLOS," Said Piane</p>
<p>"Then they asked me to join," Said Mazurek</p>
<p>Sinclair said she loves the "laughing, laughing, laughing" of the kids.</p>
<p>" Picking something about this class of kids is like asking your parents which kid they like best," Said Piane</p>
<p>Piane's favorite hobby is ... drinking coffee.</p>
<p>" I like to be with my family, cook, and run," Said Sinclair</p>
<p>The group of 2011 is a particularly talented group.</p>
<p>"The kids, they are the best group ever," Said Sinclair</p>
<p>The teachers of SLOS have some extraordinary secrets that not many people know about them.</p>
<p>"Not many people know how old I am," said Sinclair</p>
<p>"I used to have long hair, long, flowing, beautiful hair," joked Piane.</p>
<p>Mazurek is an art teacher now, but used to do some performing arts too.</p>
<p>" I used to dance a lot when I was younger," said Mazurek</p>
<p>The funs, unique, amazing, and just crazy people, make the class a great experience.</p>
