<p>The drawing class is a three-week class where the kids learn new ways to draw. This helps them understand drawing better. Every day the kids find a few pictures from magazines or something they are interested in. Then they copy the picture into a drawing. They also draw from nature. This makes them learn how to notice and draw shapes and shadows. The shapes and shadows are important to increase their level of drawing. </p>
<p>"Shadows make the world beautiful."  Keith Pitts, teacher of drawing said</p>
<p>The kids produce about one drawing a day. They will have about fifteen great drawings by the end of the three weeks. If the kids decided to do an extra three weeks, they will learn the same things but get more practice. </p>
<p>"Drawing is like learning different languages, first you learn a few words. Then you learn your ABC's. Then you learn to write and then you will learn to do more" Pitts said "They will start looking at the world differently." </p>
<p>Pitts draws along with the kids, so they can see his approach at drawing.</p>
<p> "They might open my eyes." Pitts said, "Make myself grow as an artist." "When you get older, people look for the creativity you had as a kid. The students show me that" </p>
<p>Kids who attend this class can be on any level of drawing. They learn new things and get more practice. </p>
<p>The kids all agree that they like the class because it helps them improve in their drawing skills. </p>
<p>"I like this class because it is fun. It is fun because Keith draws with us," Olivia Perozo said  "It really helps me with my drawing,"</p>
<p>Pitts teaches at Columbia College during the year. Where he teaches theater design.</p>
<p> Pitts's wife teaches jewelry design class at lab during the summer. Pitts found out about Lab through his wife. </p>
<p> Pitts's hobbies are being a dad, Reading, Softball, watching movies, cooking, and Sleeping. Pitts enjoys teaching drawing and wishes there was something magical he could say to his students. </p>
<p>Pitts has been drawing for 30 years. His first memory with drawing is when he was in 3rd grade his friend always drew donkey Kong. Everyone thought that he was very good at drawing. Pitts thought he would try to draw it. He kept practicing till he thought it was good.</p>
<p> From then on he drew from pictures in comic books. Practicing kept him motivated. </p>
<p>When Pitts went to collage his friend's dad said that art school was "pretend school." Pitts told his friend that everything in the world is inspired by art. </p>
