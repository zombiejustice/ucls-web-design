<p>David Koleta is an alumnus who has been teaching Lego building for 11 years.</p>
<p>David Koleta has been building legos since the age of 5, and he has been eager to be a teacher, but while he was in school he was hired as an assistant to build different buildings with legos, and that was the beginning of his teaching.</p>
<p>David Koleta who didn't even take lego classes, said that he learned through experience and observing pictures of different lego building on an online lego community on the Internet.</p>
<p>Koleta enjoys building with legos because it's challenging to use the lego elements to build something people wouldn't expect.</p>
<p>David Koleta has his assumption on why he thinks lego building is useful and important for kids, or even adults.</p>
<p>"I think really what it is that they are getting a problem and they have to come up with a way to solve it." Koleta said. </p>
<p>"So what I'm hoping that they can do is they're going to be problems I life that ther're facing in life, and academic problems in school, and the way to solve a problem us  to get as much information as we can and be able to apply it to the problem."</p>
<p>David Koleta his created various items with legos including a lego minora, a figure of his friend, a coffee cup, a castle for elves, a dissected frog, and many more.</p>
<p>Right now he is working on a modern house, and a lego neverland for Peter Pan.</p>
<p>Koleta has built a couple of things for charities, and there's a big online community where people build and it gets auctioned off and the money from the auction is sent to the charity Toy For Tots.</p>
<p>In Koleta's class the students normally go on a lot of field trips where they do a lot of journaling and observations of certain buildings.</p>
<p>When they are in their classrooms they build realms of te past where they focus on castles and the seven wonders of the modern world.</p>
<p>So the students read books and do research in the library, where they also learned about green architecture and Chicago architecture, that is why they go downtown to see their buildings.</p>
<p>The students also blog online where they take a picture of their creation and write a little story describing it, then they post it.</p>
<p>The students also work on vehicles, where there was three qualities. One that stays together, one hat goes as far as possible, and one that is esthetically pleasing. For this they go to the Museum of Science and Industry and research they vehicles where they will try to build it as realistic as possible.</p>
<p>Koleta wants to use all his technics and creativity to share the knowledge that he had to the next generation.</p>
