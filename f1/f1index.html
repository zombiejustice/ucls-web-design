<h1>Mr. H's Homepage</h1>
<p>Mr. H likes making dinosaur noises and teaching people about web design. Mr. H dislikes volcanos and people wearing headphones in class. Actually, he dislikes rudeness in general, not just the headphone thing. And nothing is more rude than a volcano.</p>

<div id='assignment'>
<p>Today we will be starting a new project using classes.</p>
<p>Select one of the interviews below. Ctrl-click on the link for the interview that interests you the most and select 'Download link as...'</p>
<p>Save the file into your Sites folder on the server.</p>
<p>You don't need to change the html at all!</p>
<p>Create a new file called 'interview.css' using TextWrangler.</p>
<p>Style the page using CSS!</p>
<p>There are interviews with the following five people:</p>
<p class='hyperlink'><a href='interview-project/notch.html'>Notch of Minecraft</a></p>
<p class='hyperlink'><a href='interview-project/rowling.html'>JK Rowling of Harry Potter</a></p>
<p class='hyperlink'><a href='interview-project/jordan.html'>Michael Jordan</a></p>
<p class='hyperlink'><a href='interview-project/wright.html'>Will Wright of Spore</a></p>
<p class='hyperlink'><a href='interview-project/sohn.html'>Peter Sohn of Pixar's "Up"</a></p>
</div>

<div id='windows'>
<p>If you want to work from home on a Windows computer (Dell, HP, et cetera), Mr. H has typed up some helpful directions.</p>
<p class='hyperlink'><a href='windows.html'>How to use WinSCP</a></p>
</div>

<p>Mr. H and Maddie are here to teach you web design, but if you have a question, remember to first ask a neighbor, and then try looking it up on w3schools, before raising your hand. Some of the things we've learned so far are:</p>

<h2>From First Week Friday:</h2>
<p>&lt;TAG class='CLASSNAME'&gt; is how you add a class to an element. Just like an ID! But different. TAG can be any element name.</p>
<p>TAG.CLASSNAME { } is how you select the class to style it in CSS.</p>

<h2>From From First Week Thursday:</h2>
<p>&lt;a href='FILENAME.html'&gt;LINKTEXT&lt;/a&gt; defines a hyperlink to another page on your website. Replace "FILENAME.html" with the page to which you want to link. Replace "LINKTEXT" with what you want as the clickable text of the link.</p>
<p>&lt;a href='http://ADDRESS'&gt;LINKTEXT&lt;/a&gt; defines a hyperlink to a page not on your own website. Just like above, but you replace "ADDRESS" with the URL (that is, the internet address) of the site you want.</p>
<p>a:link { } will style un-clicked hyperlinks.</p>
<p>a:visited { } will style previously clicked hyperlinks.</p>
<p>a:hover { } will style hyperlinks with the mouse over them.</p>
<p>a:active { } will style links as they are clicked on.</p>
<p>{ font-size: NUMpt; } or { font-size: NUMem } This CSS property allows you to change the size of fonts with either points or ems, which are relative to the normal font size. Example: 2em is twice as big as normal.</p>
<p>{ font-weight: bold; } This CSS property can be used to make the text in elements bolded, or bolded text normal.</p>
<p>{ font-style: italic; } This CSS property can be used to make the text in an element italicised, or italicised text normal.</p>

<h2>From First Week Wednesday:</h2>
<p>&lt;img src='FILENAME.jpg' />&gt; defines an image on the page. Like the link element, img does not close in a separate tag. Replace "FILENAME.jpg" with the picture you want to use. Make sure it's in the right folder!</p>
<p>&lt;div&gt; defines a div, which is an invisible box used to group other elements together for structure and styling.</p>
<p>&lt;TAG id='NAME'&gt; is how you give an element an ID. There cannot be two or more elements with the same ID! We will use the ID to style the element individually. "TAG" can be replaced with any element's tag, and "NAME" can be anything you want (just no spaces, and it shouldn't start with a number).</p>
<p>#NAME { CSS } This is how we style an ID. The element with the ID of "NAME" will have all the stylings inside the curly braces.</p>
<p>{ display: block; } This CSS property can be used to display an image as a block. Combine this with automatic margins to center an image.</p>
<p>{ text-align: center; } This is the CSS property for centering text. Do NOT use it to center an image; use the previous property instead.</p>

<h2>From First Week Tuesday:</h2>
<p>&lt;head&gt; defines the header part of the page, which is not seen directly by users of the webpage. It should begin right after &lt;html&gt; and end with &lt;/head&gt; right before &lt;body&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;title&gt; defines the title of the page, which is not the same as the headline. The title will be displayed at the top of the browser window! Close it with &lt;/title&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;link type='text/css' rel='stylesheet' href='FILENAME.css' /&gt; is the link element. We'll use it to link a stylesheet to our webpage. This is the first element we've learned that doesn't have a separate closing tag; that's why the tag has a slash at the end of it. Replace "FILENAME.css" with the name of your own css file.</p>
<p>{ background-color: #HEXHEX; } This is CSS, and belongs in our stylesheet (our .css file). This property will change the color of the background. Replace "HEXHEX" with the color code of your choice!</p>
<p>{ color: #HEXHEX; } This is another CSS property, which sets the color of the foreground, including text color. Replace "HEXHEX" with the color code of your choice.</p>
<p>{ font-family: "FONT1", "FONT2", FAMILY; } This CSS property sets the font to use. If the browser can't fint FONT1, it will look for FONT2, and so on down the list. The list should always end with one of the five font families: sans-serif, serif, monospace, cursive, or fantasy. There is always a default font for each of these families.</p> 

<h2>From First Week Monday:</h2>
<p>&lt;html&gt; defines the entirity of the webpage. We end the webpage with &lt;/html&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;body&gt; defines the part of the webpage that other people (not webmasters like us) can see. We close the body with &lt;/body&gt; right before &lt;/html&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;h1&gt; defines the most important headline. &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, and &lt;4&gt; can also be used. We can have as many of each as we want. Don't forget to close them!</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt; defines a paragraph of text, just like this one. We'll probably use these a lot!</p>
