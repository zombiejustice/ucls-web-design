<h1>Interview with Peter Sohn</h1>

<p class="q"> Mike: My first question -and you've talked about this before- is about how you got the idea to do a short based on the classic 'babies come from storks' fable or whatever. Give readers a brief history.</p>

<p class='a'> Peter Sohn: Okay. The idea started a long time ago. The actual spark of it started when I was a kid in New York. My mom took me to go see Dumbo, and I remember there's an opening to that film where the storks deliver all the babies. And as a kid I really was wondering where did they get all the babies from. And I had this idea that because they were birds they flew to the clouds in the sky, that's where all the babies came from.And later, I mean, like a year and a half ago was when I really started fleshing that idea out, when I was pitching it to John Lasseter. He really liked the idea, and then I started really fleshing out the characters and the actual story of what happens. But it was something that was just a seed for a long time until I got to plant it here at Pixar a couple of years ago.</p>

<p class='q'> M: Were you told the story as a kid? Did you believe it? (laughing)</p> 

<p class='a'>PS: It wasn't about believing, it's just all I really, kind of, knew as a kid. Like, I remember, that's where -like if we wanted a pet that's where the pet would come from, you know what I mean? [But] then it was really fast after learning where babies [actually] come from.It was such a innocent thing watching Dumbo. And there have been several other stories of stork delivery mistakes but I didn't really want to go there I wanted to explore the other end of it, and try to find something new about the story.</p>


<p class='q'>M: As director, how excited would you be to get an Oscar nomination for Partly Cloudy, which seems likely?</p>

<p class='a'> PS:(surprised) Ohh! Yeah, absolutely, it would be very exciting. I'm just living off the high of -I had just shown it to a crowd in Austin, Texas maybe a couple of weeks ago and just having people seeing it- cause I've shown it here to some story guys and we just had it premiere and it had a great response- but having [regular] people watch it, it's like no other feeling you'll ever have.Just hearing an audience really connect to it and laugh at something, you know, really, really enjoying something that took a while, that a whole crew put their heart into, is the most satisfying thing. I mean, have you made any films? Do you know what I'm talking about?</p>


<p class='q'>M: Do you see yourself ever helming a feature for Pixar? Is it a dream for you?</p>

<p class='a'>PS: Um, yeah. Yeah, sure. Right now, it's just, I have my ideas that I'm still kind of putting into pots, growing the seeds. When they're ready to really grow, I'll show somebody.</p>
